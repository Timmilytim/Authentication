This project is in MVC format, if you want to clone it, all you have to do is create a mysql database called "Register" or you can tweak it as you like in .yml file.
Go to the .yml file and replace you actual mail username (yourmail@gmail.com) and password (Go to your Gmail app password, not your actual gmail password, ask AI or check youTube to figure that out).
I have not done the forgot password, you can complete that if you want, I will release the REST API version soon.
